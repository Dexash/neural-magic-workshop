## Technical Capabilities

### Sparsification: Optimizing AI by Removing Redundant Parameters

Sparsification is a technique that removes unnecessary weights from AI models, reducing model size while maintaining accuracy. 
This allows AI models to run efficiently on CPUs, eliminating the need for expensive GPUs.

- Reduces unnecessary parameters in AI models.
- Increases inference speed while maintaining accuracy.
- Lowers computational cost for AI workloads.

### Quantization: Reducing Model Size While Maintaining Accuracy

Quantization converts high-precision model parameters into lower-precision representations, making models smaller and more efficient. 
This enables faster inference on commodity hardware while keeping accuracy loss minimal.

- Compresses AI models by lowering numerical precision.
- Enables faster execution on general-purpose CPUs.
- Reduces storage and memory footprint.
