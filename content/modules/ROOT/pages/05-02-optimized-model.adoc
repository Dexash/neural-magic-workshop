== Deploy the Optimized Model

== Test the Optimized Model

Now that the optimized model is deployed, you can test it by sending a request to the model, and also checking the faster response time.

=== Environment Setup

. Update the following variables in `request.py`:
   ```python
   MODEL = "your-model-name"  // Replace with your model name
   URL = "your-api-url"       // Replace with your API endpoint
   API_KEY = "your-api-key"   // Replace with your API key
   ```

=== Installation Steps

. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
   [source,bash]
   ----
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate 
   ----

. Install the required dependency:
   [source,bash]
   ----
   pip install langchain_openai
   ----

=== Running the Script

To run the script and measure execution time:
[source,bash]
----
time python request.py
----

This will execute the script and display:
* The script's output
* Real time (wall clock time)
* User CPU time
* System CPU time
