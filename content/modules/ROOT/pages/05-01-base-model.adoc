== Deploy the Base Model

== Test the Base Model

Now that the model is deployed, you can test it by sending a request to the model, and also checking the time it takes to respond.

=== Environment Setup

. Update the following variables in `request.py`:
+
[source,python]
----
MODEL = "your-model-name"  // Replace with your model name
URL = "your-api-url"       // Replace with your API endpoint
API_KEY = "your-api-key"   // Replace with your API key
----

=== Installation Steps

. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
+
[source,bash]
----
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
----
. Install the required dependency:
+
[source,bash]
----
pip install langchain_openai
----

=== Running the Script

To run the script and measure execution time:
[source,bash]
----
time python request.py
----

This will execute the script and display:

* The script's output
* Real time (wall clock time)
* User CPU time
* System CPU time
